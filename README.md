# yaba-social

Yet Another Boilerplate App created with [Expo v31](expo.io), [react-navigation v3](reactnavigation.org), [themed with styled-components](www.styled-components.com), [Apollo Client](www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)+[GraphQL](graphql.org), and ~~a smidge of Redux for demo purposes~~ absolutely zero Redux, the global state is also getting managed by Apollo Client.

_Mega updated for 2019!_ Now more organized and 1000% less fugly: design skills were on my list of things to improve on in 2018 :P
